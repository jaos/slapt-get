   to the final configuration.  --remove-obsolete and --retry were not
   being honored.

0.10.2b Oct 17, 2009
 * modified disk checking mechanism so that the working directory filesystem
   is checked for downloads and then / is checked for the uncompressed size.
   This is not 100% ideal since /usr may be on another filestem but it should
   make Tadgy slightly happier.  Added slapt_disk_space_check to public API.

0.10.2a Sep 14, 2009
 * updated el translation from George Vlahavas
 * updated es_ES translation from Angelos
 * added --filelist option using slapt_get_pkg_filelist

0.10.1 Dec 12, 2008
 * fixed an initialization errror in slapt_is_required_by() that
   caused a segfault when removing with --no-deps.
 * if no package sources are defined with a priority, disable use of
   priorities when dealing with /patches.  This prevents the previous
   default slapt-get behavior from changing and causing confusion.  With
   priorities, /patches is always assigned +1 above the package sources
   priority.  So if no priorities were in use then anything found in any
   sources /patches always trumped anything else.  This is probably the
   most correct behavior but it is still unexpected for existing users.
   To get the correct behavior, assign a priority to one or more sources.
 * reordered priorities to "default < official < preferred < custom" as
   this seems to be more intuitive.  Having preferred less than official
   is confusing.

   packages and their dependencies so as to not try and remove uninstalled
   packages

 * make --ignore-dep ignore conflicts on upgrade
 * test updates
 * Romanian translation by Reteaua PTM.
