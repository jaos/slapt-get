 1. Features

    slapt-get tries to emulate Debian's apt-get as closely as possible.

    * uses native Slackware tools (installpkg, upgradepkg, and removepkg)
    * supports packages as tgz, tlz, tbz, and txz files
    * supports multiple package sources with the ability to assign priorities to each source.
    * cache data concerning packages and updates from package sources
    * supports sources from ftp, ftps, http, https, file:/// and more (libcurl)
    * resumes broken downloads and will verify package integrity with MD5 checksum
    * show packages that are available (from cached data) and installed
    * search package listing using POSIX and extended regular expressions
      by package name, location, and description
    * retrieve, install, and remove packages by name or by specific version
    * retrieve and apply updates
    * upgrade from one Slackware release to another in a few simple steps
    * show description of packages, including mirror location, version, size,
      dependencies (where available), conflicts (where available), suggestions
      (where available), description, installation status, and the package
      changelog entry (where available).
    * exclude (hold) packages from upgrades, by name or by regular expression
    * transaction engine for install, remove, and upgrades, reporting concise
      information on what is to be done, ensuring each step happens correctly
    * "compare package version" algorithm to prevent downgrades
    * recursive dependency resolution using slack-required meta-data (see FAQ)
      supporting hard, soft, and conditional dependencies
    * package conflict resolution using slack-conflicts meta-data (see FAQ)
    * package suggestion support for complimentary packages (see FAQ)
    * Package data download robustness, only writing changes if all sources
      download successfully as well as only downloading those sources that
      have changed since the last download
    * i18n support via GNU gettext with over 30 language translations
    * extremely fast and easy to script with



 2. Requirements

    slapt-get requires Slackware-9.0 or better, due to glibc and openssl
    updates.  You can also use slapt-get under Slackware 8.1 if you
    upgrade glibc-solibs and openssl from Slackware 9.0, or if slapt-get
    is built statically linked.

    The following packages are required to build slapt-get from source:
    make, gcc, curl, glibc, kernel-headers, binutils, zlib, gettext-tools,
    and openssl.

    If gpgpme is installed, slapt-get can be built with support
    for signature verification with gnupg. gpgme requires libgpg-error.

    The unit tests in t/ require check (http://check.sourceforge.net/).



 3. Installation

    You can install via meson or make (deprecated).

    * Meson

        meson setup build # or any dir of your choosing
        meson compile -C build # or `ninja -C build` for older meson releases
        meson install -C build # or `ninja -C build install`  for older meson releases

        Meson/ninja supports `DESTDIR=/path meson install -C build`

        TIP:
        slapt-get.Slackbuild will create a Slackware package.
        Run with sudo or as a privileged user.

    * make (deprecated)

        make
        make install # as privileged user

        The Makefile honors DESTDIR.

        TIP:
        `make pkg` (as privileged user) will create a Slackware package.



 4. slapt-getrc

    The slapt-getrc file consists currently of the following keys:
     SOURCE
     WORKINGDIR
     EXCLUDE

    Choose a mirror from the slackware.com mirror list at
    http://www.slackware.com/getslack/

    * SOURCE must be a path to a valid Slackware release directory,
    or a third party source (see example within rc).
    All that is required is the PACKAGES.TXT (see FAQ entry #17)
    and CHECKSUMS.md5.  Multiple sources can be defined.

      NOTE: It is not recommended to mix 3rd party package sources
            with the official on production servers.  Sometimes
            third party sources contain the same packages as the
            official mirrors. Third party packages might not be
            as rigorously tested as official packages.

    Each SOURCE can be a assigned a priority level, by appending :{PRIORITY} to
    the source URI.  For example:

      SOURCE={url}:DEFAULT    is the default, lowest priority
      SOURCE={url}:PREFERRED  assigns more weight to this source
      SOURCE={url}:OFFICIAL   even more weight, used to denote official sources
      SOURCE={url}:CUSTOM     highest priority, for your custom package source

    See the FAQ for more information.

    * WORKINGDIR will hold the package data and downloaded packages.
      This directory will be created automatically as permissions
      allow.

    * EXCLUDE is a comma separated list of packages you want excluded from
    updating. This can be the package name, or a extended POSIX regex.
    For example, to exclude Dropline, use .*-[0-9]dl$.  See regex(7).



 5. Getting started

    After installing and customizing the slapt-getrc configuration file,
    you need to run slapt-get with the --update option to download the
    package data available from all the package sources you specified within
    the slapt-getrc file.

    Once this is done, you can use the following options:

    * --upgrade to upgrade your installed packages.
    * --dist-upgrade to upgrade to a newer release (Please refer to the FAQ
      concerning dist-upgrade prior to running the command).
    * --search to locate packages of interest by the package name, disk set,
      or version.  This supports POSIX and extended regular expressions.
    * --install to install a package.  If the package is already installed it
      will be upgraded.
    * --list to see all the packages available from the package sources you
      specified within the slapt-getrc configuration file.
    * --installed to list all the packages you already have installed.
    * --remove to remove packages.
    * --show to show information about packages.
    * --clean to remove all downloaded packages from the local cache.
    * --autoclean to remove packages from local cache that are no longer
      available on the package sources specified in the slapt-getrc file.
    * --remove-obsolete along with --remove or --dist-upgrade will mark
      all non-downloadable packages for removal.




 6. Troubleshooting

   Probably some bugs.  Email bug reports to me:
    Jason Woodward <woodwardj at jaos dot org>

   or file a github issue: https://github.com/jaos/slapt-get/issues

   Make sure --update is ran once initially and the data file (package_data)
   is good.

   Some mirrors are incomplete and the downloaded file is actually HTML
   specifying the web servers error message.  MD5 checking has been
   incorporated in order to alleviate this problem.

   Please do not add redundant mirror locations to the same release.  Mirror
   fall back is not implemented (see FAQ #50).  Also, any time the source url(s)
   are changed, slapt-get --update must be run to update the local cache.

   If you are getting segfaults, add -g to CFLAGS in the Makefile, change the
   DEBUG define in src/main.h to 1, and rebuild ( make clean && make ).  Run
   in gdb and let me know via email where the fault happens.

   Run the test suite and report any failing tests to github issues.

   See the FAQ for more info.
